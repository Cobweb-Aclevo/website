# About Cob:web-Aclevo

Cob:web-Aclevo is a development and content creation group centered around creating free, innovative, open source technology for the future. We have a diverse, unique range of projects. We have projects relating to software & software development, videos and multimedia, gaming and gaming communities.

As a group we have three core values: 

###### Free and Open-Source Software

We at Cob:web-Aclevo believe in open source software, and we will actively create software that is free to use, and open source. We believe in the validity and security that open source software brings, as well as the benefits of having an active community submit requests and actively contribute to the projects that they use, and love the most. This is why all of our projects are licensed under GPL3.

- At the moment Cob:web-Aclevo may use third-party services such as Cloudflare and GitHub pages. 

###### Privacy and your data

We value privacy, and we also value our users privacy. This is why you will find no advertisements, third-party cookies or any privacy concerning features on Cob:web-Aclevo. We ensure that all of our applications and software does not store, or use user-data so that you can remain anonymous whilst using our applications. Privacy matters, and we feel that other technology companies should follow our agenda and adopt a new privacy policy which puts the user and their data first. 

###### Security

We will always try to maintain and ensure that our apps are secure, however if a vulnerability is found, due to the open-source nature of our software you can either submit a fix yourself or contact one of our developers to bring the issue up with them so that we can ensure that everyone is protected whilst using our application.
