<h1>About Cob:web-Aclevo</h1>
<p>Cob:web-Aclevo is a development and content creation group centered around creating free, innovative, open source technology for the future. We have a diverse, unique range of projects. We have projects relating to software &amp; software development, videos and multimedia, gaming and gaming communities.</p>
<p>As a group we have three core values:</p>
<h6>Free and Open-Source Software</h6>
<p>We at Cob:web-Aclevo believe in open source software, and we will actively create software that is free to use, and open source. We believe in the validity and security that open source software brings, as well as the benefits of having an active community submit requests and actively contribute to the projects that they use, and love the most. This is why all of our projects are licensed under GPL3.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the moment Cob:web-Aclevo may use third-party services such as Cloudflare and GitHub pages.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Privacy and your data</h6>

We ensure that all of our applications and software does not store, or use user-data so that you can remain anonymous whilst using our applications. Privacy matters, and we feel that other technology companies should follow our agenda and adopt a new privacy policy which puts the user and their data first.</p>
<h6>Security</h6>
